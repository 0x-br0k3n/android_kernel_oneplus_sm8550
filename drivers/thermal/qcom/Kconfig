	  This enables a thermal sysfs driver for Qualcomm plug-and-play (QPNP)
	  PMIC devices. It shows up in sysfs as a thermal sensor with multiple
	  trip points. The temperature reported by the thermal sensor reflects the

	  This enables initialization of Qualcomm limits management
	  hardware(LMh). LMh allows for hardware-enforced mitigation for cpus based on
	  input from temperature and current sensors.  On many newer Qualcomm SoCs
	  LMh is configured in the firmware and this feature need not be enabled.
	  However, on certain SoCs like sdm845 LMh has to be configured from kernel.

	   This enables the QTI CPU Pause cooling device. These cooling
	   devices will be used by QTI chipset to pause a CPU from being
	   scheduled and hence will let the CPU to power collapse.  Pausing
	   a CPU will be used when the CPU frequency mitigation
	   is not good enough to achieve the necessary cooling.

	help
	  This driver provides routines to configure and monitor the BCL
	  PMIC peripheral. This driver registers the battery current and
	  voltage sensors with the thermal core framework and can take

	help
	  This driver registers battery state of charge as a sensor with
	  thermal framework. This sensor can monitor for state of charge
	  thresholds and notify the thermal framework when the thresholds
	  are reached and cleared. This will help to monitor and apply any
	  mitigation when state of charge goes below a certain threshold.

	help
	   This enables the QTI CPU Hotplug cooling devices. These cooling
	   devices will be used by QTI chipset to hotplug a CPU to achieve
	   thermal cooling. CPU Hotplug will be done after core isolation,
	   to prevent any process from waking the mitigated CPU.

	help
	    This enables the QTI CPU Voltage cooling devices. This cooling
	    device will allow the CPUs with different frequency plan in a
	    cluster to be mitigated together based on the voltages. This will
