	  sharing, IRQ sharing, IPC/signalling mechanisms, and so on.

	  Say Y here to enable the drivers needed to work on Gunyah

        help
          Gunyah offers a simple inter VMs(Virtual Machines) communication
          through the use of doorbell interrupts. A single doorbell instance
          provides an unidirectional communication between two VMs and it acts
          like either a source(Tx) or generate(Rx). Individual VMs make use of
          these doorbells by calling send and/or a receive primitives exposed by
          driver and trigger an interrupt to each other and exchange the data.

config GH_MSGQ
        tristate "Gunyah Message Queue driver"
        help
          Gunyah offers message-queues as one of the IPC mechanisms to
          communicate among the Virtual Machines. The message queue drivers
          runs on the Virtual machines to provide an interface to the clients
          who wish to communicate to other clients on a different VM. Currently,
          the services offered by the drivers is simply to send and receive
          messages in a blocking manner.
