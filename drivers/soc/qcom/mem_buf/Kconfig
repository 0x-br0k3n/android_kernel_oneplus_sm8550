	  Enables additional support for sharing memory with VMs that have their own
	  operating systems, as opposed to peripheral VMs, which do not have their
	  own operating systems. These VMs are managed by the Gunyah Hypervisor, and thus
	  sharing memory with them requires interacting with the Gunyah Hypervisor.
	  If unsure, say N.
