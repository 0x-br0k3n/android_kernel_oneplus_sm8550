	help
	  This framework supports the Internet Packet Accelerator (IPA3) core.
	  IPA is a programmable protocol processor HW block.
	  It is designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets
	  for various use cases independent of radio technology.
	  The driver support client connection and configuration
	  for the IPA core.
	  Kernel and user-space processes can call the IPA driver
	  to configure IPA core.

	  PCIe controller is in endpoint mode.
	  It supports the APIs to clients as a service layer, and allows
	  clients to enable/disable PCIe link, configure the address
	  mapping for the access to host memory, trigger wake interrupt
	  on host side to wake up host, and trigger MSI to host side.

	  PCIe endpoint HW specific implementation.
	  It supports:
		1. link training with Root Complex.
		2. Address mapping.
		3. Sideband signaling.
		4. Power management.
